# gravity-simulation
This project's purpose is to simulate gravitational interactions between various objects (example: Solar System) in 2D environment. 

## Contents:
- ["gravity.py"](/gravity.py)  > library (not complited)
- ["vector.py"](/vector.py)   > library
- [example **Solar System** simulation](/temporary-v_alfa-solar-system-simulation.py)

## Info:
This project uses "pygame" to render simulation, so it's necessary to have pygame module installed to run it properly.

## Requirements:
- python
- pygame module
